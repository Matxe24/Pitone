# Installation

WARNING: I PERSONALLY RECCOMEND USING THE COMPILATOR, IT HAS MORE FREEDOM AND IT'S BETTER TO USE THAN THE SHELL, AND NOW WE EVEN HAVE A VISUAL STUDIO CODE EXTENTION CALLED "Pitone"

you can try Pitone directly in your browser now!!: https://pitone.onrender.com

To use pitone, i reccomend copying the repository on every distro(and windows too) and using the compilator.

On arch based distro do:

yay -S pitone (it installs both, the shell and the compilator)

on other distros do this command:

git clone https://github.com/Matxe24/Pitone && cd compilator && cd linux && chmod +x make.sh &&./make.sh (reccomended)

or if you want the shell do: git clone https://github.com/Matxe24/Pitone && cd shell && cd linux && chmod +x make.sh &&./make.sh (not reccomended, the compilator is more stable)

On windows copy the repository, go in the folder compilator(or shell if you want the shell but it's not reccomended) then windows, then open a terminal in it and run the script.

then just do: python3 filename.pi
